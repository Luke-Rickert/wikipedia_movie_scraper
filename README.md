# wikipedia_movie_scraper
This program integrates web scraping for data extraction and sqlite for data storage. The program pulled data from Wikipedia, stored it in a database and then queries are written to search data.

NOTE: The web request now returns a 403 response code because of anti-bot detection, so the program no longer works :(
